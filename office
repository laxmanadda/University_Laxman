When Git stores a new version of a project, it stores a new tree 
It is built to be worked on simultaneously by many people, having multiple branches developed by individual developers, being merged, branched and re-merged constantly.

First of all- microframeworks are not yet mainstream. That may soon change especially with the rapid growth of interest in the Serverless Architectures. 
Serverless really benefits from small and lightweight deployments- if you want to use Java in that context, microframeworks seem like a good choice.

Another big driver for their popularity is the increasing adoption of containers (Docker), containers management systems (Kubernetes) and patterns such as API Gateway. 
Suddenly, the services do not need to deal with as many problems as they used to.
